# Employee Retention Prediction
## Project Overview:
This project is the capstone project for the Advanced Google Data Analytics Certificate.
The goal of the project is to analyze the data collected by the HR department of Salifort Motors and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.
It is important to be able to predict employees likely to quit beause we can identify factors that contribute to their leaving. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company.
## About the Dataset:
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains 15,000 rows and 10 columns, with 9 independent variables and the target variable "left".
