# White Wine Quality Prediction
## Project Overview:
The aim of this project is to produce a model that predicts the quality of white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine based on various physicochemical characterics of the wine. The model can also help determine which characterstics have the biggest effect on taste preferences when distinguishing between higher or lower quality wine.
## About the Dataset:
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains 4898 rows and 12 columns, with 11 independent variables and the target variable "quality".
## Input Variables:
- Fixed acidity
- Volatile acidity
- Citric acid
- Residual sugar
- Chlorides
- Free sulfur dioxide
- Total sulfur dioxide
- Density
- pH
- Sulphates
- Alcohol
## Output Variable:
- Quality
